# Sales-Data-Analysis-using-Python
Utilising Python Pandas &amp; Python Matplotlib to examine and respond to business inquiries on sales data across 12 months. Hundreds of thousands of electronics shop purchases are included in the data, which is split down by month, product type, price, location of purchase, etc. 

In this project I tried to answered business questions related to our data:- 
1. What was the best month for sales?How much was earned that month?
2. What city sold the most product?
3. What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
4. What products are most often sold together?
5. What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
